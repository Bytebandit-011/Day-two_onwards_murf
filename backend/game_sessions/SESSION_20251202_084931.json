Bringing in Phineas and Ferb as co-creators is definitely a bold choice, and I appreciate the creativity there. However, the core challenge was explaining *why* the paintings turned into memes, and I felt like we didn't quite get that specific explanation. It was more of a general announcement about the future of art. You skirted around the 'meme' part a little! Good effort on the imagination, but let's try to hit those specific scenario points next time, eh?"
